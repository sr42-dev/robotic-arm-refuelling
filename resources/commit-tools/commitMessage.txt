joint trajectory controller implemented for arm, car urdf modified with receptacle

changes since last commit :
- joint trajectory controller for 5 dof arm completed
- inertia new arm to be tuned and used
- car urdf modified with female component and visual odometry pattern

near term features pending (deadline - 16th June, 2023) :
- inertia for dofbot to be tuned and used
- car controller
- demo scripts for static refuelling with cvbridge
- new car urdf with arm & male connector
- adjust inertia values for dofbot components
- testing to collect data for static refuelling (write nodes)
    - time for refuelling
    - payload capacity
    - end effector details
    - arm velocity
    - edge detections
    - docking and undocking time
    - alignment accuracy while docking (x, y, z)

long term features pending :
- demo scripts for dynamic refuelling
- patent & publication writing
- multidimensional synchronization for dynamic case (tbd) 
- in-space arm docking (tbd)
